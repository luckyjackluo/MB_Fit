    Adds energies to be calculated to an existing database.

        settings_path       - Local path to the ".ini" file with all relevant settings.
        database_config_path - .ini file containing host, port, database, username, and password.
                    Make sure only you have access to this file or your password will be compromised!
        training_set_path      - Local path to the ".xyz" training set file.
        method              - QM method to use to calculate the energy of these configurations.
        basis               - QM basis to use to calculate the energy of these configurations.
        cp                  - Use counterpoise correction for these configurations?
        tags                - Label this calculation with these tags.
        optimized 			- Are these configurations optimized geometries? Default is False.
